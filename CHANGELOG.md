## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Language

- **Inline assembly functions** — `asm func Name(...) -> T { ... }` bodies are written directly in x86-64 (Intel syntax) and assembled to machine code, bypassing the normal HIR/LIR pipeline. Supports the common instruction subset (ALU ops, `mov`/`lea`, `movzx`/`movsx`, the multiply/divide group, shifts, `push`/`pop`, `call`/`jmp`, the full `jcc`/`setcc` family, `ret`/`leave`/`nop`/`syscall`), register/immediate/memory operands, local labels, and calls to other functions.

#### CLI / Package Manager

- `rux uninstall --global` — remove every package from the global cache, whether or not the current `Rux.toml` declares it. Completes the `--global` set alongside `rux list --global` and `rux update --global`.

### Changed

- **Workspace test discovery** — `rux test` at a workspace root now discovers each member package's `Tests/` directory in addition to the root `Tests/`, so test packages can live beside the code they cover. Tests found under a member are labeled with the member's name (`Text/Tests/Compare` reports as `Text/Compare`), and a root `Tests/` keeps working as before.
- **Native Linux calling convention** — ordinary and inline-assembly Rux functions now use the System V AMD64 ABI on Linux, including `rdi`/`rsi`/`rdx`/`rcx`/`r8`/`r9` integer arguments, 16-byte call-site stack alignment, and stack-passed overflow arguments. `@[Call(.Win64)]` remains available as an explicit override.

### Fixed

- **Dependency compilation** — `rux check` and `rux build` now share the same dependency-loading pipeline, so installed and path-based dependencies are available during semantic analysis and unresolved dependencies stop before code generation.
- **Zero-operand assembly parsing** — instructions such as `syscall` followed by `ret` are now parsed as two instructions instead of treating the second mnemonic as an operand.
- **Attributes on extend methods** — annotations such as `@[Target(...)]` are now accepted on methods inside an `extend` block instead of failing with "expected 'func' in extend body" (#197).
- **Module scope in call resolution** — a call now binds to a function from its own module or from a module the file imports, in preference to a same-named function declared elsewhere in the program. Functions in different modules are no longer treated as overloads of one another, and two modules that would emit the same symbol are disambiguated by their module path, so importing one package could silently redirect a call into another.
- **Constants of slice type** — `const Name: T[N] = [...]` and `const Name: char8[] = "..."` are now emitted into read-only data with a `{data, length}` header, instead of an eight-byte placeholder that was never filled in. Reading, indexing, iterating or taking the `.length` of such a constant crashed at runtime. Elements may be literals, negated literals, or other named constants; anything the backend cannot lay out is now a compile error rather than a corrupt read.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-23

Adds broad multi-platform host support, a revamped platform abstraction layer, new language features, a macOS linker backend, and Windows DLL output, along with correctness fixes, broader literal and constant-expression support, improved overload resolution, expanded runtime support, better test coverage, cleaner CLI/build tooling, and many bug fixes.

### Added

#### Language

- **Target attributes** — `@[Target(...)]` attributes to conditionally compile code per platform
- **Unicode escape sequences** — `\u{...}` escapes in string and character literals
- **Constant integer expression coercion** — compile-time folded integer expressions now coerce to sized integer targets when the value fits
- **Typed non-decimal integer suffixes** — `0xFFu`, `0b1010u`, `0o17i`, and underscore separators in non-decimal literals
- **Constant character cast validation** — compile-time validation for `as char8`, `as char16`, and `as char32`
- **Boolean bitwise operators** — `&`, `|`, `^`, and `~` on `bool` types
- **Attribute handling improvements** — `@[Target(...)]` import filtering by platform, plus warning and error attribute support (`@[Warn(...)]`, `@[Error(...)]`)

#### Runtime / Linker

- **Windows PE32+ DLL output** — emit `.dll` artifacts when `Type = "Dll"` in `Rux.toml` (export directory, optional `DllMain`)
- **macOS Mach-O linker backend** — native x86-64 Mach-O executable output on macOS
- **macOS `munmap` thunk** — adds `munmap` support to the Mach-O linker so `Std::Memory::Free` can release mmap-backed allocations
- **Floating-point remainder support** — adds FP `%` handling
- **Floating-point comparison fixes** — correct FP comparison behavior

#### Platform

- **OpenBSD x86-64 host** — native compilation and execution on OpenBSD x86-64
- **NetBSD x86-64 host** — native compilation and execution on NetBSD x86-64
- **DragonFly BSD x86-64 host** — native compilation and execution on DragonFly BSD x86-64
- **Illumos x86-64 host** — native compilation and execution on Illumos/OmniOS x86-64
- **Platform abstraction layer** — revamped `Platform` implementation with platform macros and CPU feature detection at runtime
- **BSD and Illumos ELF target support** — correct ELF OSABI, `PT_NOTE`, `ET_DYN` per target
- **Target-specific platform dependencies** — `[Target.<Platform>.Dependencies]` in `Rux.toml`

#### Syscall Thunks

- `nanosleep` and `clock_gettime` typed syscall thunks (Linux)
- `RtlCompareMemory` thunk (Windows)

#### CLI / Package Manager

- `rux check` — type-check the current package without producing a binary
- `rux info [--json]` — display installed package information; `--json` outputs machine-readable JSON
- `rux install --dev` — install a package as a dev dependency
- Inline TOML table dependency fields in `Rux.toml`

### Fixed

#### Semantics / Type Checking

- **Overload resolution** now hard-errors on unresolved overloads instead of silently falling back
- **Bare integer literals** now work in single-overload resolution
- **Binary expression operands** are now type-checked on both sides
- **`is` folding** now produces a compile-time boolean instead of emitting a fake call
- **Tuple size / field offset layout** is now aligned consistently across backends
- **Pointer arithmetic** now scales by element size
- **Slice-of-slice assignment** no longer corrupts the slice length field
- **Import resolution** for `import Std::Io` / module-qualified calls is fixed
- **Compatibility checks** for mixed character and integer types are relaxed where appropriate
- **Platform-conditional imports** under `@[Target(...)]` are filtered correctly during dependency collection
- Enums and type aliases not resolving inside `extern` blocks
- `bool` and `float` type handling regressions
- Double pointer parsing bug

#### Language Diagnostics

- **Constant casts** now reject out-of-range character values and Unicode surrogate code points
- **Out-of-range integer literals** now produce clearer diagnostics outside `let` bindings
- **Unsigned/sized integer literal handling** is now consistent across decimal, hex, binary, and octal forms

#### Codegen / Runtime

- Integer `**` (power) operator — defines `__rux_ipow` runtime helper
- **SysV stack argument passing** is restored in codegen
- Entry stack alignment: pre-adjust RSP before `call Main`
- `ReadFile`/`WriteFile` thunks: preserve R9 across syscall, guard `mov [r9]` with null check, preserve non-volatile RDI/RSI on Win64

#### Platform / Build

- **Windows CMake linking** issues are fixed
- **GCC/MinGW** terminal-link workaround is added
- **Install/uninstall** now work outside project directories
- **Help command handling** is cleaner, more robust, and terminal-width aware
- **Type dependency resolution** and wildcard target handling are fixed
- Platform dependency resolution via wildcard targets and robust TOML parsing
- OpenBSD ELF header fixes for `execve` compatibility
- **OpenBSD test cases** are removed where they no longer apply
- Windows `std::max` macro conflict with compiler internals
- UB in `gitclone` due to missing `return`
