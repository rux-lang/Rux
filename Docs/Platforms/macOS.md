# Rux on macOS

This guide covers installing and building Rux on x86-64 and AArch64 macOS. Return to the [main README](../../README.md) for language documentation and project information.

## Installing a Release

A native macOS release is not currently published. Build Rux from source using the instructions below.

## Building from Source

Rux currently requires Clang 22.1 or newer, CMake 4.3 or newer, Ninja 1.11 or newer, and a recent Git installation. Apple Clang does not yet provide all C++26 features used by Rux, so install upstream LLVM 22 and the build tools with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install llvm@22 cmake ninja git
```

Clone and build Rux with Homebrew's Clang:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rux-lang/Rux.git
cd Rux
sh Build.sh --compiler "$(brew --prefix llvm@22)/bin/clang++"
```

The script creates a Release build in `Build/` and writes the compiler to `Bin/rux`.

For a Debug build, add `--configuration Debug`. Run `sh Build.sh --help` to see every option.

On Apple Silicon, Rux selects the `macos-aarch64` target by default. The AArch64
backend lowers Rux LIR through the system Clang driver, which applies the
AAPCS64 ABI and writes a native AArch64 Mach-O executable. Keep the Xcode Command
Line Tools installed so `/usr/bin/clang` is available when compiling Rux
programs.

## Verifying the Build

Run the compiler:

```sh
./Bin/rux version
file ./Bin/rux
```

On Apple Silicon, `file` should report a `Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64`.
Programs built by `./Bin/rux build` should report the same architecture.

Run the complete repository verification workflow with the same Homebrew compiler:

```sh
sh Test.sh --compiler "$(brew --prefix llvm@22)/bin/clang++"
```

Static analysis is intentionally opt-in because it is slower:

```sh
sh Test.sh --compiler "$(brew --prefix llvm@22)/bin/clang++" --clang-tidy
```

Use `sh Format.sh` to format maintained C++ and Rux sources, or `sh Format.sh --check` to check them without making changes.
